# Analysing: 

# 1) Biodiversity of ant communities along an elevational gradient and 

# 2) Taxonomic composition of arthropods along plant diversity gradient in the Jena Experiment

**Course:** Quantitative Community Ecology in R

**Authors:** Evangelos Karapoulis, Julian Nico Thiem, Gian Luca Naccarato

**Supervisors:** Felix May & Oksana Buzhdygan - Theoretical Ecology Lab

## Task 2) 

### Step by step

1\) Does data responds linearly? –\> DCA to access gradient length (\< 3 = Linear); In any case I personally prefer to use distance-based methods; The most widely used method in ecology is nowadays an NMDS with post-hoc vector analysis; Since we‘re dealing with abundance data I would suggest using the Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity as distance matrix

2\) Constrained or unconstrained methods? In our case we do have predictors, but again, I would prefer using an NMDS and post-hoc vector fitting using either the envit() function or the ordisurf() function

... but first lets see how the data looks like etc.
