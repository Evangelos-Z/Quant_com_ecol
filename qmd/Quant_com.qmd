# Analysing:

# 1) Biodiversity of ant communities along an elevational gradient and

# 2) Taxonomic composition of arthropods along plant diversity gradient in the Jena Experiment

**Course:** Quantitative Community Ecology in R

**Authors:** Evangelos Karapoulis, Julian Nico Thiem, Gian Luca Naccarato

**Supervisors:** Felix May & Oksana Buzhdygan - Theoretical Ecology Lab

## Task 2)

#### Data analysis

To extract the main gradients of anthropod composition, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the Hellinger-transformed species matrix (Legendre & Gallagher 2001). The data transformation was applied due to high differences in the abundances of the individual taxa. By subsequently taking the square root of the relative species abundances, the importance of dominant species groups is reduced (Borcardet al. 2011).

Subsequently we fitted vectors onto the plot ... following the approach of Legendre & Gallagher (2001).

## Results

The PCA projection revealed important changes in arthropod composition along the plant diversity gradient. Axes 1 and 2 represented 58.44% of the variance of the Hellinger-transformed species matrix.

-   using envit() function

**Transformation of environmental data:**

-   we have presence absence data (functional plant groups)

-   and we have species diversity data (2,4,8,16) of sawn species, do weed need to transform them into categories (1,2,3,4,5)?

## Further Notes:

Here is a paper from the Jena Experiment dealing with anthropodes and plant diversity:
